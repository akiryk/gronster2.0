gronster 2.0
========

A drawing game built with cake php and javascript. 
The idea of the game is for three participants to each draw one portion of a creature -- head, body and legs.
The app stores the separate drawings in a mysql database and combines them into one png image once all are finished. 

#Update app on gronster.adamkiryk.com
Redefine ROUTEPATH in bootstrap.php from 'localhost' to 'gronster.adamkiryk.com'
